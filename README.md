# sfmaze
Generates random mazes using depth first search.

## Features (TODO)
- [x] Read maze from binary file
- [x] Write maze to binary file
- [x] Generate random maze
- [x] Display the maze as it's being generated in an SFML window

Basically the same as my python version: [pymaze](https://github.com/MixusMinimax/pymaze)
